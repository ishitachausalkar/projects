# CSYE - 6225 (Library management System Api)
==================================

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for Bookes.

### Prerequisites

To run this you need to have postman,nodejs,mysql and npm installed on your machine. 

### How to use

Git clone this repo on your local machine.

Run following query commands in mysql

create 'books' database in mysql and create following table in it

```
	CREATE TABLE `user` (
	`id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	`username` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	`password` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	`cdate` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
	) ENGINE=InnoDB;
```

```
	CREATE TABLE `books`.`book` (
  	`id` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  	`title` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  	`author` VARCHAR(100) NULL,
  	`isbn` VARCHAR(255) NULL,
  	`quantity` INT NULL,
  	PRIMARY KEY (`id`));
```

To add image field in Book table run following query

```

ALTER TABLE books ADD COLUMN image VARCHAR(255) AFTER quantity;
```

To create image table with id and url run following query

```

CREATE TABLE `image` (`id` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,`url` VARCHAR(255) NULL);
```


and run following commands 

```
-	cd ccwebapp/webapp
-	npm install
-	node index.js	
```

and then open http://localhost:3000 on postman to check following scenarios.

1. 	Create new user by accessing http://localhost:3000/user/register with username and password in postman using content type - application/json.
	-	if user already exists then it will print user already exists.
	-	else it will create user with generating bcrypt encoded hash.

2.	When user access this http://localhost:3000 url without passing basic authentication it will return error message.
	-	if user passes valid creds then it will show current date in json response.		

3.	It satisfies all user stories required in assignment00.01 and assignment1.


and for testing run following command.

```
	mocha
```
